d = √(x₂-x₁)²+(y₂-y₁)²

Euclidean distance is the "ordinary" straight-line distance between two points in Euclidean space. With this formula, you can find the distance between two points in a plane or in three-dimensional space.

Defining Points:

I created a list named 'points'. This list should contain tuples representing points in 2D space. For example, a point '(x, y)' will be represented as a tuple '(x, y)'.

Writing a Function for Euclidean Distance:

I defined a function named 'euclideanDistance'. This function should take two tuples (each representing a point) and return the Euclidean distance between these two points.

Calculating Distances:

Using a loop, I calculated the Euclidean distances between each pair of points in the 'points' list. I stored these distances in another list named 'distances'.

Finding the Minimum Distance:

I found and printed the minimum distance from the 'distances' list.
